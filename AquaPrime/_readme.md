# Aqua Prime Grumpy Cat AI Documentation

## Overview

The Aqua Prime Grumpy Cat AI is a component of the Aqua Prime game‚Äîa Discord-based Tabletop Role-Playing Game (TTRPG) that combines economic strategy, education about cryptocurrency, and interactive storytelling. The Grumpy Cat AI serves as the game's Dungeon Master, providing witty and humorous responses in the character of Grumpy Cat to players' interactions and inquiries. The AI utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 engine to generate contextually relevant and engaging responses.

# Purpose

The Grumpy Cat AI enhances players' immersion within the Aqua Prime universe by delivering responses that align with the in-game narrative and player interactions. The AI takes on the persona of Grumpy Cat, a popular internet meme, and maintains character throughout interactions, contributing to the satirical and entertaining nature of the game.

# Key Features

Contextual Responses: The AI leverages past player messages and interactions to build context. It includes both recent in-game conversations (RAM) and long-term history (HDD) of player interactions to provide more personalized and relevant responses.

Dynamic Prompts: The AI constructs prompts for the OpenAI GPT-3.5 engine that include:

## Operating System (OS) Section: A static game world setting description

### Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Section: Historical information about the player and related users

### Random Access Memory (RAM) Section: Recent in-game conversation messages

### System Section: Grumpy Cat's character and role description

### User Input Section: The current user's input message

### Mentioned Users Section: Any mentioned users in the input message

### Collaborative Storytelling: The AI facilitates collaborative storytelling within the Aqua Prime universe, driving engaging role-playing interactions between players and NPCs

## Usage

Players interact with the Grumpy Cat AI through Discord messages. When the AI is mentioned in a message, it processes the message's context, retrieves historical data from a MongoDB database, searches for additional context in Weaviate, and constructs a prompt for the OpenAI engine. The AI generates a response based on the prompt and delivers it back to the Discord channel.

## Components

### WeaviateClient: A class that interfaces with Weaviate, an external data source, to retrieve context relevant to player interactions

### OpenAI: A class that interacts with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 engine to generate responses based on prompts

### Bot Framework: The Discord bot framework handles interactions with the Grumpy Cat AI, retrieves historical messages, constructs prompts, and delivers AI-generated responses to the Discord channel

# Implementation

The Grumpy Cat AI is integrated with the Aqua Prime Discord bot using Python. The codebase consists of classes for interfacing with external data sources, creating prompts, and generating AI responses. The AI maintains Grumpy Cat's character by using the same tone, language, and humor expected from the meme.

# Conclusion

The Aqua Prime Grumpy Cat AI enhances the immersive experience of the Aqua Prime game by providing contextually relevant and entertaining responses. By taking on the role of the iconic Grumpy Cat, the AI adds a layer of humor and engagement to player interactions, contributing to the unique and engaging gameplay of Aqua Prime.
